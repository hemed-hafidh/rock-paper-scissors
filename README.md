# rock-paper-scissors

This is a project from [The Odin Project] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) curriculum.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple rock-paper-scissors game using Javascript with no gui interface. The game run on console developer tool. It is played between human and random guess provided by the computer, it runs in five round and then stop.

## Technologies Used

-HTML5
-JavaScript
-Git/github

## What I learned

I learned that assigning a function's return value to a variable (e.g., let humanSelection = getHumanChoice()) only saves the result of that specific moment. To generate new results for every round of a game, the function must be called inside the game loop or the play function. This ensured that the computer (and the player) made a fresh "choice" every time the user clicked a button.
